when connecting from the pgadmin to the db it's possible to do that in 2 ways:

1. forward a "public" port to the container and use either the external ip or 127.0.0.1 as the pgadmin is on the same machine
2. use the podman dns name ("db_db_1") that way the pgadmin will connect from the internal podman network.



flask endpoints - if the app is simple you can just run app = flask(_name_) and the ep's will be @app.route(/url/)

flask blueprints - while it's possible to create manual endpoint it's easier to create a blueprint. 
the blueprint will include all endpoint which has the endpoint_name.route in them, that wasy we can register them into the main app by importing them.
after we created the flask app they will be refered to as modules.

flask config -best practice:
1. create a config folder/file
2. in your app.py (either init or just whenever) run app.config.from_object() the object here should be the path to the configuration for example
folder config file default_config.py class settings ->  'config.defaul.config.settings' this should be inserted as string.
